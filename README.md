## Description

This is a portfolio of my work, showcasing my projects and highlighting my strongest pieces of work and my thought process behind it.
This was started as a challenge for Week 2 of the program but will be helpful in my career search. This project will include the application of core skills learned in week 2 like CSS flexbox, media queries and variables.
